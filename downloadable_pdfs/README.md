## a DATA VAULT ANALOGY
Data Vault in the industry has two standards, one following the Hans Hultgren method (Ensemble Modelling) and the other follows Dan Linstedt (Data Vault 2.0). Sometimes the terms of the two are confused and to the untrained eye it is difficult to tell who is following which method, which of course adds to the confusion of learning about Data Vault. Ensemble tends to lean towards replacing Kimball, Data Vault 2.0 does not - instead DV2.0 keeps the patterns simple and repeatable.

## How I can get away without paying the Pied Piper... in Data Vault 2.0
What you learn on DV2.0 training is that a Data Vault model is not easy to query, to make it easier and to support your Information Models you build Point-in-Time and/or Bridge tables but the expense of querying the data vault is pushed to the creation of the PIT tables themselves. But what if you don’t have to?	bit.ly/3mNxuD9
